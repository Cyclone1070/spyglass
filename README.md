## Using your own Google CSE

To use your own Google CSE, you need 2 free services from Google:

-   Google Programmable Search Engine: get the `Search Engine ID` and make sure to enable `Search the entire web` option or you can add your own custom website list.
-   Google Custom Search JSON API: get the `API Key`.

Go to the website, enter `Search Engine ID` and `API Key` and you're all set!
